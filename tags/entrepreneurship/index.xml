      <description>&lt;p&gt;On May 22, 2025, I had the opportunity and privilege to speak in front of a group of selected young students participating in a hackathon organized by &lt;a href=&#34;https://hackai.ma/&#34;&gt;hackai&lt;/a&gt;. My mission was simple yet deeply meaningful to me: to openly share my journey as an entrepreneur who started as a developer, highlighting the lessons learned, the challenges I encountered, and the personal growth opportunities I&#39;ve discovered along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Being an introvert myself, I particularly wanted to offer insights and practical advice to those who, like me, dream of achieving greater freedom and self-realization through entrepreneurship, despite (or perhaps even because of) their quieter personalities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
