[{"body":"Welcome to the Compose theme user guide!

Please note that the features listed under each theme are independent of each other. That is to say, some features may only be found in one theme and not in both.\nCompose Theme Docs Clarity Theme Docs ","link":"https://jawad.dev/docs/","section":"docs","title":"Themes' Docs"},{"body":" Prerequisites First ensure that you have hugo installed.\nYou need a recent extended version (we recommend version 0.61 or later) of Hugo to do local builds and previews of sites (like this one) that uses this theme.\nIf you install from the release page, make sure to get the extended Hugo version, which supports sass; you may need to scroll down the list of releases to see it.\nFor comprehensive Hugo documentation, see gohugo.io.\nRun your site with compose theme You could go with the options right below.\nOption 1 (my favorite) This option enables you to load compose theme as a hugo module. First things first, ensure you have go binary installed on your machine.\n1$ git clone https://github.com/onweru/compose/ 2cd compose/exampleSite/ 3hugo server To pull in theme updates, run hugo mod get -u ./... from the theme folder. If unsure, learn how to update hugo modules\nThe exampleSite uses the theme as a hugo module by default.\nIf you choose Option 2 or Option 3 below, ensure you edit these lines in the hugo.toml file as advised on the comments. Else, you will not be able to pull theme updates.\nOption 2 (recommended) Generate a new Hugo site and add this theme as a Git submodule inside your themes folder:\n1hugo new site yourSiteName 2cd yourSiteName 3git init 4git submodule add https://github.com/onweru/compose/ themes/compose 5cp -a themes/compose/exampleSite/* . 6git commit -m \u0026#34;setup compose theme\u0026#34; Then run\n1hugo server Hurray!\nOption 3 (Great for testing quickly) You can run your site directly from the exampleSite. To do so, use the following commands:\n1git clone https://github.com/onweru/compose/ 2cd compose/exampleSite/ 3hugo server --themesDir ../.. Although, option 3 is great for quick testing, it is somewhat problematic when you want to update your theme. You would need to be careful not to overwrite your changes. Once set, jump over to the hugo.toml file and start configuring your site.\n","link":"https://jawad.dev/docs/compose/install-theme/","section":"docs","title":"Install theme"},{"body":"Do you prefer managing your site using a CMS? Or would you like to make it easier for someone (a non-techie, perhaps) in your team to make edits easily? If interested, follow along. Else, skip to the next section\nLet's sync your site with Tina CMS.\nPrerequisites !! Obviously you ought to have a github account. This is where your website source will live. Basically, Tina will read from github and write (commit) to your github repo.\nGitlab or bitbucket will work too. Just check their implementation here. Happy fishing. Requirement 1 : A Tina.io account Jump over to Tina.io and sign up for an account. Consider signing up using your github account. That way, you don't have to deal with passwords.\nRequirement 2: A Netlify account (optional) If you intend to host with something other than Netlify e.g github pages, please scroll on. Hosting with Netlify is a lot of fun though; I highly recommend it.\nStep 1 : Fork or Clone Compose theme First we will fork this theme's template.\nStep 2 : Add your repository in Tina CMS The exampleSite already comes with prefilled placeholder Tina settings. If you set up your site using option 2 Edit ./static/tina/config.js and replace tina CMS tokens with values from your own Tina account\n1... 2 clientId: \u0026#34;6ff9830b-b18a-4d21-b38c-cae1679e335f\u0026#34;, // replace 3 token: \u0026#34;2954980a0db18868974dc57a66be9ecdfe6f336b\u0026#34;, // replace 4... 5search: { 6 ... 7 tina: { 8 indexerToken: \u0026#34;977c145439dda036080dd7a33478d2ba385ab5af\u0026#34;, // replace 9 stopwordLanguages: [\u0026#34;deu\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;eng\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;fra\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ita\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;spa\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;nld\u0026#34;] // consider adding or removing languages https://github.com/fergiemcdowall/stopword#language-code 10 }, 11 ... 12 } 13...

Unlike other regular pages, the documentation pages will have a left sidebar. This sidebar will list links to all the pages in the documentation pages. Beneath each link, there will be a collapsible list of table of contents' links. These nested lists will unfold automatically on the active/current page.\nHome Page At the root level there's an _index.md page which is the homepage. Feel free to edit it as you like.\nOther pages You can also add as many regular pages as you like e.g about.md, contact.md...\nTake advantage of shortcodes to customize the layouts of these pages and any other.\nDoes this theme support blogging function? Currently, no.\n","link":"https://jawad.dev/docs/compose/organize-content/","section":"docs","title":"Content organization"},{"body":"Instead of writing all your site pages from scratch, Hugo lets you define and use shortcodes.\nWhy shortcodes? While markdown is sufficient to produce simple pages, it's insufficient where complex page structures are needed. Thusly, whenever we need special styling, shortcodes compliment the shortcomings of markdown.\nThis way, you can side step complex html and css boilerplate in your content files.\nSometimes, the shortcode will wrap content, sometimes it won't. When content is wrapped, a closing shortcode tag is needed. Please see the link I provided above and the markdown files for examples. You'll get the gist pretty quickly.\nI've setup the following shortcodes:\nBlock Takes positional modifiers\nExample\n1... 2 {{\u0026lt; block \u0026#34;modifiers\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} 3 \u0026lt;!-- Nest columns or content --\u0026gt; 4 {{\u0026lt; /block \u0026gt;}} 5...

By default Fuse is applied. Algolia can be enabled by adding this settings to config/_default/params.toml file\n1# search 2[search] 3on = true 4global = false 5[search.algolia] 6enable = false # if false search will default to fusejs 7id = \u0026#34;Q40WQQX84U\u0026#34; # Application ID 8index = \u0026#34;compose\u0026#34; # Index name 9key = \u0026#34;da87401a458102ec6bbd6cc5e5cf8d95\u0026#34; # Search-Only API Key Both search engines will display results using the same UI. By choosing the default (.ie fuse js), you will be opting for local search. This way, no additional setup is needed.\nAlgolia will require you to build and host your index. For those using Github, this theme ships with an algolia github action.\nBy default, search will return results from the current content section. Searches from the top level section e.g the homepage, will return global results. This way, the results are scoped. You can override this behaviour using this setting\n1... 2[search] 3... 4global = false # turn to `true` to enable global search 5... At the time of this writing, search on these theme takes either of this forms:\n1. Passive search This occurs only when the user loads the search page i.e /search/. They can directly navigate to that url. Alternatively, the user can type you search query on the search field and click enter. They will be redirected to the search page which will contain matched results if any.\n2. Live search This behaviour will be obvious as the user types a search query on the search field. All valid search queries, will yield a list of quick links or a simple no matches found. Else, the user will be prompted to continue typing.\nPlease note that the results under quick links will be a truncated list of the most relevant results. Only a maximum of 8 items will be returned. This number is pragmatic at best if not arbitrary. On the search page, the number is set to 12.\nNote that live search on the search page will behave differently than on the other pages. Nonetheles, the pages apply the same live search principle.\nHitting enter while typing on the search page will be moot as that page’s content will live update as you type in the search word / phrase.\nCustomize search feedback labels Use the i18n files to do so.\nWhat is a valid search query A valid search query must be long enough. If the search query can be cast as a float, then it only need contain one or more characters.\nElse the search query must be at least 2 characters long.\n","link":"https://jawad.dev/docs/compose/search/","section":"docs","title":"Search Function"},{"body":"Mermaid is library that helps you generate diagrams, flowcharts, and piecharts from text in a similar manner as markdown.\nWith compose theme, you can use mermaid using a custom shortcode as follows:\nSequence Diagrams Snippet\n1{{\u0026lt; mermaid \u0026gt;}} 2sequenceDiagram 3 participant Alice 4 participant Bob 5 Alice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you? 6 loop Healthcheck 7 John-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria 8 end 9 Note right of John: Rational thoughts\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;prevail... 10 John--\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Alice: Great! 11 John-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;Bob: How about you? 12 Bob--\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Jolly good! 13{{\u0026lt; /mermaid \u0026gt;}} Result\nsequenceDiagram\rparticipant Alice\rparticipant Bob\rAlice-\u003e\u003eJohn: Hello John, how are you?\rloop Healthcheck\rJohn-\u003e\u003eJohn: Fight against hypochondria\rend\rNote right of John: Rational thoughtsprevail...\rJohn--\u003e\u003eAlice: Great!\rJohn-\u003e\u003eBob: How about you?\rBob--\u003e\u003eJohn: Jolly good!\rFlow Charts Snippet\n1{{\u0026lt; mermaid \u0026gt;}} 2flowchart TB 3 c1--\u0026gt;a2 4 subgraph one 5 a1--\u0026gt;a2 6 end 7 subgraph two 8 b1--\u0026gt;b2 9 end 10 subgraph three 11 c1--\u0026gt;c2 12 end 13 one --\u0026gt; two 14 three --\u0026gt; two 15 two --\u0026gt; c2 16{{\u0026lt; /mermaid \u0026gt;}} Result\nflowchart TB\rc1--\u003ea2\rsubgraph one\ra1--\u003ea2\rend\rsubgraph two\rb1--\u003eb2\rend\rsubgraph three\rc1--\u003ec2\rend\rone --\u003e two\rthree --\u003e two\rtwo --\u003e c2\rGraphs Snippet\n1{{\u0026lt; mermaid \u0026gt;}} 2graph TB 3 sq[Square shape] --\u0026gt; ci((Circle shape)) 4 5 subgraph A 6 od\u0026gt;Odd shape]-- Two line\u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;edge comment --\u0026gt; ro 7 di{Diamond with \u0026lt;br/\u0026gt; line break} -.-\u0026gt; ro(Rounded\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;square\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;shape) 8 di==\u0026gt;ro2(Rounded square shape) 9 end 10 11 %% Notice that no text in shape are added here instead that is appended further down 12 e --\u0026gt; od3\u0026gt;Really long text with linebreak\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;in an Odd shape] 13 14 %% Comments after double percent signs 15 e((Inner / circle\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;and some odd \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;special characters)) --\u0026gt; f(,.?!+-*ز) 16 17 cyr[Cyrillic]--\u0026gt;cyr2((Circle shape Начало)); 18 19 classDef green fill:#9f6,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px; 20 classDef orange fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px; 21 class sq,e green 22 class di orange 23{{\u0026lt; /mermaid \u0026gt;}} Result\ngraph TB\rsq[Square shape] --\u003e ci((Circle shape))\rsubgraph A\rod\u003eOdd shape]-- Two lineedge comment --\u003e ro\rdi{Diamond with line break} -.-\u003e ro(Rounded\nsquare\nshape)\rdi==\u003ero2(Rounded square shape)\rend\r%% Notice that no text in shape are added here instead that is appended further down\re --\u003e od3\u003eReally long text with linebreak\nin an Odd shape]\r%% Comments after double percent signs\re((Inner / circle\nand some odd special characters)) --\u003e f(,.?!+-*ز)\rcyr[Cyrillic]--\u003ecyr2((Circle shape Начало));\rclassDef green fill:#9f6,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;\rclassDef orange fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px;\rclass sq,e green\rclass di orange\rSnippet\n1{{\u0026lt; mermaid \u0026gt;}} 2graph LR 3 A[Hard edge] --\u0026gt;|Link text| B(Round edge) 4 B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} 5 C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result one] 6 C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result two] 7{{\u0026lt; /mermaid \u0026gt;}} Result\ngraph LR\rA[Hard edge] --\u003e|Link text| B(Round edge)\rB --\u003e C{Decision}\rC --\u003e|One| D[Result one]\rC --\u003e|Two| E[Result two]\rClass Diagram classDiagram\rAnimal \u003c|-- Duck\rAnimal \u003c|-- Fish\rAnimal \u003c|-- Zebra\rAnimal : +int age\rAnimal : +String gender\rAnimal: +isMammal()\rAnimal: +mate()\rclass Duck{\r+String beakColor\r+swim()\r+quack()\r}\rclass Fish{\r-int sizeInFeet\r-canEat()\r}\rclass Zebra{\r+bool is_wild\r+run()\r}\rState Diagram stateDiagram-v2\r[*] --\u003e Active\rstate Active {\r[*] --\u003e NumLockOff\rNumLockOff --\u003e NumLockOn : EvNumLockPressed\rNumLockOn --\u003e NumLockOff : EvNumLockPressed\r--\r[*] --\u003e CapsLockOff\rCapsLockOff --\u003e CapsLockOn : EvCapsLockPressed\rCapsLockOn --\u003e CapsLockOff : EvCapsLockPressed\r--\r[*] --\u003e ScrollLockOff\rScrollLockOff --\u003e ScrollLockOn : EvScrollLockPressed\rScrollLockOn --\u003e ScrollLockOff : EvScrollLockPressed\r}\rstateDiagram-v2\rState1: The state with a note\rnote right of State1\rImportant information!

This article is a direct regrouping and rephrasing of those posts, with no added or removed content — only organized for clarity.\n📌 Table of Contents Evaluation is your main driver The real battle begins in Production Regression Testing and Guardrails: The Hidden Heroes Evaluation inside the Agentic Loop Building for Scale and Automation 1. Evaluation is your main driver Most tech teams have been missing a key point when evaluating AI systems It's not new. Even back in the classical ML days, I noticed this pattern:\nwe stuck to abstract, generic metrics (accuracy, F1-score, etc.) instead of designing domain-specific ones that truly reflect business value.\nToday, I'll go even further:\n👉 𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 𝗰𝗹𝗶𝗲𝗻𝘁-𝘀𝗽𝗲𝗰𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗰 𝗺𝗲𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗰𝘀: metrics that align exactly with your client's goals and values.\nSpoiler: 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘀𝗲 𝗼𝗳𝘁𝗲𝗻 𝗯𝗼𝗶𝗹 𝗱𝗼𝘄𝗻 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗼𝗻𝗲𝘆 💲 𝗥𝗢𝗜.\nConcrete example.

As a data scientist, my answer is NO. at least, not in the strict sense of the word.\nHere's why:\nEvaluation without a gold standard is just another opinion.\nOr if you prefer: it's more of an 𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝗻 𝗮𝗻 𝗲𝘃𝗮𝗹𝘂𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻.\nDon't get me wrong! I'm not saying LLM-as-a-judge is useless. It can provide useful signals to improve your system, 𝗲𝘀𝗽𝗲𝗰𝗶𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝗵𝘂𝗺𝗮𝗻 𝗲𝘃𝗮𝗹𝘂𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝗮𝗿𝗲𝗻'𝘁 𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲.\nBut calling it evaluation is misleading, because you're 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗼 𝗮 𝘀𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗰𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗿𝘂𝘁𝗵.\nAs a data scientist, I've already seen this kind of confusion, especially when discussing unsupervised learning evaluation.\nIf you've worked in data science, you know:\nEvaluation in unsupervised learning is tricky. You often have to 𝘁𝗶𝗲 𝗶𝘁 𝗯𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝘁𝗼 𝗮 𝘀𝘂𝗽𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗮𝘀𝗸 𝗼𝗿 𝗮 𝗯𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗼𝘂𝘁𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗲 𝘁𝗼 𝗮𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗶𝘁𝘀 𝘃𝗮𝗹𝘂𝗲.\nSame goes for evaluating text generation.\n𝗦𝗼 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗱𝗼 𝘄𝗲 𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗹𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗹𝘆?\n✅ Define expected outputs at the data point level so you can apply real metrics.\n✅ Don't ask the LLM to reason, ask it to compare your system's output against a reference.\n✅ Let them help you understand why an output deviated, not just whether it's good or bad.\n✅ Instead of relying on end-to-end judgment, look at what each agent or tool is doing in your system.\nWhat does it mean to evaluate RAG? Is it worth doing? How do we break it down into multiple steps, and what's the most critical part?\nFirst, understand that 𝗥𝗔𝗚 𝗶𝘀𝗻'𝘁 𝗷𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝗮 𝘁𝗲𝘅𝘁-𝗯𝗮𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝘀𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺. It can involve various data types and formats integrated into the LLM's context.\nRAG can cover API calls, SQL databases, web searches, and of course vector databases.\nTo control your agent's output quality, you must ensure quality at every process step.\n𝗜𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝘀𝗽𝗮𝗰𝗲, 𝗿𝗲𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘃𝗮𝗹 𝗶𝘀 𝗰𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹, because it involves multiple sub-steps:\nThe agent builds the query itself. You need to assess whether it's doing this correctly. ex: not misusing database tools or accessing unauthorized data. Evaluate the real targets (entities, lines, documents, or chunks) that should be retrieved and used as context. Then compute metrics like false positives and false negatives. Problems can also come from your knowledge base. You need clean, curated data, especially during the building and testing phases. And ensure you're building efficient context retrieval! If the data you're feeding the LLM is too big (and isn't focused on what needs to be shown to the user) you'll lose your LLM's attention, even with models that support large contexts. 𝗧𝗵𝗲𝗻, 𝗮𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗽𝗮𝗿𝘁. 3 key points to evaluate:\n𝗛𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘂𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 and Non-Based Information: Is the output strictly based on your RAG context? Errors here could come from model quality, prompt design, or lack of guidance. 𝗥𝗲𝗹𝗲𝘃𝗮𝗻𝗰𝘆: Does the generation highlight the right parts of the context? Is it structured as expected, per prompt policy or fine-tuning? 𝗘𝘅𝗵𝗮𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗶𝘁𝘆: Is the generated text exhaustive? Be cautious, some filters in the prompt might deliberately exclude parts of the retrieved data. 𝗥𝗔𝗚 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗺𝗼𝘀𝘁 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗮𝗻𝘁 𝗽𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗲𝘃𝗮𝗹𝘂𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗶𝗻 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘀𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺. It's where most issues originate. Break it down and evaluate each part carefully.\n✅ Study your errors and keep track of them in neat and well-defined automated tests.\n✅ Build a robust test framework with a diverse query set and reference answers.\n✅ Use metrics like precision, recall, and context relevance for retrieval.\n✅ For generation, focus on faithfulness and answer relevance.\n✅ Regularly update your evaluation datasets based on real-world usage.\n✅ Use LLM-based evaluators to scale your assessment efficiently.\n2.

It's far more correlated with the number of real cases processed in production.\nWhy?\nBecause evaluation isn't meaningful until your system has faced a wide range of inputs... and even then, some edge cases won't appear until you're operating at scale.\nHere's what we've observed again and again:\n✅ Complex agent tasks can perform flawlessly in dev, but start breaking down under production load or when inputs deviate even slightly from the original distribution.\n✅ Free text input is unpredictable. No matter how creative your dev team is, users will always surprise you.\n✅ It's not just LLMs : rate limits, data quality issues, and fragile pipelines will all show up once the volume kicks in.\n✅ Even your data pipelines need to be stress tested at scale. You'll spot performance cliffs and resilience gaps only under pressure.\nScaling to production gives your team real signals:\nWhat breaks? Where is the system fragile? What improvements would make the most users happy? With enough volume, your team gets the feedback it needs to iterate faster and with higher confidence.\nScaling isn't a nice-to-have.\nIt's the prerequisite for building reliable and evolving AI systems.\nProduction support and online evaluation are not just ops tasks, they're strategic levers for your team. After months running AI systems 24/7, one thing is clear:\n𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗶𝘀 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝘂𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗻𝗲𝘅𝘁 𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻.\nEvaluation before prod is critical, but watching real user interactions is what sharpens your instincts and helps prioritize what matters.\nHere's how we 𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗻 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗺𝗼𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗼𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗼 𝗮 𝘀𝘂𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗽𝗼𝘄𝗲𝗿:\n🔁 Make it a team-wide habit: Everyone in the team should get 𝗮 𝘁𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗱𝘂𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗮.

Regression Testing and Guardrails: The Hidden Heroes Your 𝗴𝘂𝗮𝗿𝗱𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗹 is the 𝗺𝗼𝘀𝘁 𝗰𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗽𝗮𝗿𝘁 of your multi-agent system. It's your system's gateway. 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗳𝗶𝗿𝘀𝘁 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗹𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗱𝗲𝗳𝗲𝗻𝘀𝗲. 𝗙𝗶𝗿𝘀𝘁 𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲 (keeps the chaos out) when it's the input guardrail:\nhelps you catch out of scope/unexpected inputs (things your workflows weren't designed to handle). With these kinds of input, you're almost guaranteed to get unreliable, unpredictable results. It's also your security guard: detecting jailbreaks, prompt injections, and malicious inputs. 𝗟𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲 (keeps the chaos in) when it's the output guardrail:\nIt helps drastically reduce hallucinations. It can flag out-of-scope topics that slipped past the input guardrail. It should also enforce brand moderation, keeping responses aligned with company image and policies. Think of building a 𝗿𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗴𝘂𝗮𝗿𝗱𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗹 as a hard 𝗰𝗹𝗮𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺. Like any classification task, you're tuning the threshold between false positives (blocking good inputs) and false negatives (letting bad ones through).\n𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗻𝗴𝗲?\nYour input and output is human language: open-ended, messy, context-dependent. The distribution is huge, and the ambiguity is real. There's no perfect line.\n𝗛𝗲𝗿𝗲 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝘀𝗼𝗺𝗲 𝘁𝗶𝗽𝘀 𝗶𝗳 𝘆𝗼𝘂'𝗿𝗲 𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺:\n✅ Define clear and concise policies: Set strong guidelines for how your guardrail should behave.\n✅ Inject necessary information: Feed the guardrail only with data needed to make the right decision.\n✅ Define good and bad examples: Help it learn what should be let through - and what shouldn't.\n✅ Test different LLM models: Your guardrail is your most important agent. Pay the necessary price to have best quality.\n✅ Evaluate performance: Use metrics like accuracy, recall, and precision. Better yet, build custom metrics tied to business impact.\n𝗦𝗼𝗹𝗶𝗱 𝗴𝘂𝗮𝗿𝗱𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘀 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘃𝗮𝗹𝘂𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗔𝗜 𝘀𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺𝘀 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗼𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗼𝗻𝗲𝘀.\n4. Evaluation inside the Agentic Loop Data extraction evaluation matters in agentic systems When building an agentic system, it's important to have data points 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗯𝗲 𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗱 𝗮𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗵𝗲𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝗲𝗻𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂'𝗿𝗲 𝗼𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝗽𝗮𝘁𝗵.\nThink of these as intermediary milestones, deliverables you're asking your multi-agent system to produce on its way to the ultimate objective.\nThese checkpoints serve a dual purpose:\n𝗧𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗶𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗠𝗲𝗮𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀: They provide clear metrics that simplify system monitoring and facilitate the evaluation of each agent's performance. 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗜𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀: They offer valuable data that can enrich your understanding of the automated process and even serve as a source of structured knowledge about your users. Moreover, these data points should be used to establish hard controls, dictating actions that agents must or must not take based on the extracted information.\nAdditionally, this metadata functions as a form of memory. Ensuring that agents get this information at critical steps of the process and that it's never lost.\n𝗪𝗮𝗻𝘁 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗿𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀?\n𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝗱𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘀𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗰𝗸𝗽𝗼𝗶𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗱.\n5. Building for Scale and Automation R\u0026amp;D is not optional. Be ready to pay for experimentation. If you want to bring cutting-edge AI systems to production, you'll need to build an R\u0026amp;D mindset into your team and invest in experimentation.\nThe challenge?\nKeep experimentation 𝗳𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗮𝗳𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗱𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲.\nYou want feedback in 𝗱𝗮𝘆𝘀, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝘄𝗲𝗲𝗸𝘀.\nAnd just like any expert team, to move fast you need the right tooling.\nAs your production matures and your agent tasks become more complex, your tools need to scale with you.\nAt NORMA, when we started building multi-agent systems, we hit a clear bottleneck: Maintaining constant quality was slowing down our shipping velocity.\nSo, we built something.\n𝗔 𝘁𝗼𝗼𝗹 𝘁𝗼 𝘁𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗔𝗜 𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝗲𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝗲𝗻𝗱, 𝗮𝘁 𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗲.\nIt started as an internal utility.\nToday, it's a full platform for teams who need to control agent quality over time and evaluate changes across versions efficiently.\nYou want reliable and efficient AI? 𝗠𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝘁𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗲𝗮𝘀𝘆 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝘁𝗲𝗮𝗺!\n𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝘁𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗱𝗲𝗿 𝗶𝗻 𝗔𝗜 𝗽𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺:\nYour input is challenging to control and fully cover. LLMs are everywhere in your pipeline, each bringing potential variance to your process. Many steps rely on structured outputs from LLMs, which aren't always easy to obtain systematically. Agents may access external sources you don't fully control. Outputs vary widely: generated text, finite decision spaces, data extraction... AI frameworks themselves are still evolving quickly and might introduce instabilities or deprecate parts of your code overnight. For all these reasons, developers often struggle to build new features while maintaining high production quality and stability.\n𝗗𝗼𝗻'𝘁 𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿-𝗽𝗹𝗮𝗻, 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝗮𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗲𝘀𝘁𝘀 𝗻𝗼𝘄 𝘁𝗼 𝗿𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗲𝘃𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗱𝗲𝘃 𝘁𝗲𝗮𝗺.\nAnything that reduces developer workload is worth pursuing. For example:\nBegin with a simple script that automatically runs tests and saves results to an accessible folder. Execute these tests in parallel to accelerate feedback. Provide a clear dashboard or interface for easily inspecting results. Encourage your team to establish metrics to continuously monitor overall quality. Start by measuring outputs globally, then prioritize evaluating the most critical sub-steps, usually those handling data manipulation.\nAfter several iterations, your developers will become comfortable with evaluation processes, naturally integrating these tests to ensure high-quality features. At NORMA, we’ve even automated evaluation directly into our CI/CD pipeline for every PR 🔥\nCheck our quik demo here: ","link":"https://jawad.dev/blog/multiagents_lessons/","section":"blog","tags":"AI,Production,Evaluation","title":"From PoC to Production"},{"body":"","link":"https://jawad.dev/tags/production/","section":"tags","title":"Production"},{"body":"","link":"https://jawad.dev/tags/","section":"tags","title":"Tags"},{"body":"","link":"https://jawad.dev/tags/entrepreneurship/","section":"tags","title":"Entrepreneurship"},{"body":"On May 22, 2025, I had the opportunity and privilege to speak in front of a group of selected young students participating in a hackathon organized by hackai. My mission was simple yet deeply meaningful to me: to openly share my journey as an entrepreneur who started as a developer, highlighting the lessons learned, the challenges I encountered, and the personal growth opportunities I've discovered along the way.\nBeing an introvert myself, I particularly wanted to offer insights and practical advice to those who, like me, dream of achieving greater freedom and self-realization through entrepreneurship, despite (or perhaps even because of) their quieter personalities.\nWhen I started my entrepreneurial journey, I quickly observed two main types of businesses. Some are profitable from day one, usually service-based businesses. Others require initial funding to develop their profitability. Given my French-Moroccan cultural background, bootstrapping, which is building a business with minimal investment, was naturally my prefered choice. Our relationship with risk and money tends to be cautious, often shaped by insecurity rather than optimism (yeah... that's the truth).\nBeyond the financial aspects, entrepreneurship has taught me invaluable lessons about personal growth and ambition. Early on, I understood the importance of fully embracing my strengths and refusing mediocrity. Yet this mindset sometimes caused friction: people might interpret ambition as arrogance or unnecessary perfectionism. I learned not to compromise on my standards just because others saw things differently. Money is indeed essential, but for entrepreneurs, it primarily serves to improve the likelihood of our project's success, not simply as an end goal.\nAn essential realization was that entrepreneurship means solving problems for other people. Genuine curiosity about others' lives and difficulties is foundational. If you're seeking tranquility or a predictable life, entrepreneurship probably isn't the right path. For me, entrepreneurship became a continuous practice of stepping outside my comfort zone, understanding that there's always something new and important to master.\nComfort is tricky: you need a baseline level to sustain long-term efforts, but too much comfort can stifle growth. I found it crucial to regularly push my boundaries, constantly absorbing new skills and knowledge.\nOver time, I also realized entrepreneurship isn't necessarily the ultimate ambition for everyone nor should it be. At one point, I considered joining an existing team as a CTO, thinking I might be happier in a secondary role. The right opportunity never emerged, not because good teams didn't exist, but simply due to timing. Eventually, I found people I'd gladly join, reminding me how critical timing and context are in our decisions.\nAnother powerful lesson was about humility. I observed brilliant individuals from strong academic backgrounds who often fell prey to a superiority complex. Believing success was owed to them, they underestimated the constant hard work required. Entrepreneurship rapidly dispels any illusions of entitlement.\nOne crucial practice I've adopted is always giving my best to people who trust and follow me. Nothing is more powerful than a unified team, and that unity is built on genuine effort and mutual respect. However, this requires sometimes blind trust in others. While some experiences might disappoint you, investing your time and trust in people consistently opens new opportunities.\nI had to become okay with discomfort in other ways too like paying upfront to learn or taking risks by selling ideas before fully executing them. Initially, this went against my natural instinct for caution, but it proved crucial in creating new opportunities and connections.\nTwo metrics emerged as especially meaningful for me: the number of new people I meet each day and my ability to maintain quality conversations with them. I've worked consciously to improve these metrics, finding that they directly impacted my entrepreneurial success.\nInstead of dwelling on what I lacked or what seemed impossible, I learned to focus strictly on the value I could deliver and the actions within my control. Playing the victim never advanced anyone's goals. Though we don't all begin our journey from the same point, it's more productive and satisfying to concentrate on possibilities rather than obstacles.\nFailures inevitably happened. I also learned not to expect constant support from close friends or family. Initially, their perceived lack of support frustrated me, but I eventually understood that their apparent reluctance was not personal; often, they were already burdened by their own concerns and fears.\nAccepting my weaknesses was another critical breakthrough. Being average in certain areas won't necessarily limit success. Ego and imposter syndrome plagued me frequently, but gradually diminished as I learned to see them simply as temporary feelings rather than truths.\nTo grow effectively, I discovered that hiring or collaborating with people smarter or more capable than myself was indispensable. I used to hesitate, worried that this could highlight my shortcomings. Now, I seek out these relationships deliberately, knowing they're the quickest path to improvement.\nMy perspective expanded further when I began exploring economics and game theory, understanding that entrepreneurship is about far more than hard skills. Working on my resilience also allowed my creativity to flourish. Building resilience will buy you enough time to spark innovation.\nAlongside resilience, learning to work comfortably in teams and exposing myself regularly to criticism proved immensely beneficial. It strengthened my confidence and clarified my ideas. This also required a conscious effort never to judge prematurely. I've realized repeatedly that good and bad qualities coexist in everyone. There's potential common ground with any person if you look openly enough and if it aligns with your business goals.\nProfessionalism, perhaps more than any other single quality, became fundamental in my entrepreneurial life. Clearly communicating intentions, and consistently doing what you promise, is powerful and irreplaceable. Yes, some people inevitably take advantage of your goodwill, but I've learned that this isn't always negative, provided it helps move your project forward positively.\nAbove all, entrepreneurship demands courage. Not just the courage to lead but also to openly depend on others. Initially, I was hesitant to ask for help, mistakenly seeing self-reliance as strength. Entrepreneurship quickly corrected this misconception, as trying to handle everything alone became exhausting and counterproductive. Learning to ask for help turned out to be one of my most important lessons.\nLastly, I learned not to take myself too seriously. I couldn't control every outcome or constantly sacrifice my own well-being for others. Sacrifices inevitably happen, yet choosing entrepreneurship in a field I genuinely love—m (math and technology) made these sacrifices easier to accept.\nEveryone defines success differently. For entrepreneurs, the relationship between time invested and immediate financial reward can feel frustratingly disconnected. I had to gradually separate the value of my time from immediate compensation. Results often arrive later, sometimes much later, as the business grows. This delayed gratification felt destabilizing at first, especially when accustomed to direct compensation.\nUltimately, my choices affect other people's lives. I've had to accept responsibility for the relationships, opportunities, and even problems my decisions create.\nOver the past few months, I've felt new challenges emerging, pushing me even further outside my comfort zone: First, my team has grown to a size where it's becoming difficult to provide individual attention and guidance to everyone. Second, there's an exciting but challenging opportunity to develop a product using a dogfooding approach. Lastly, I find myself needing to spend more and more time outside the company, creating new business opportunities and maintaining strong relationships with our clients.\nFor all these reasons, I've decided to seek the support of a professional coach who will help me navigate this next phase with greater confidence and clarity.\n","link":"https://jawad.dev/blog/5-years-of-norma/","section":"blog","tags":"Entrepreneurship,PersonalGrowth","title":"Lessons learned (so far) as an introvert entrepreneur"},{"body":"","link":"https://jawad.dev/tags/personalgrowth/","section":"tags","title":"PersonalGrowth"},{"body":"","link":"https://jawad.dev/blog/","section":"blog","title":"Blog"},{"body":"","link":"https://jawad.dev/categories/","section":"categories","title":"Categories"},{"body":"\rHi!
