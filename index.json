Basically, Tina will read from github and write (commit) to your github repo.\nGitlab or bitbucket will work too. Just check their implementation here. Happy fishing. Requirement 1 : A Tina.io account Jump over to Tina.io and sign up for an account. Consider signing up using your github account. That way, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to deal with passwords.\nRequirement 2: A Netlify account (optional) If you intend to host with something other than Netlify e.g github pages, please scroll on.

In this first module we will:\nReview the notation and basic statistical concepts that will recur throughout the course. Introduce our running motivating example: predicting house prices using regression. By the end of this lesson you should feel comfortable with symbols like \\(y\\), \\(\\mathbf{x}\\), \\(\\boldsymbol\\beta\\), and be ready to formulate and fit your first linear model.\nNotation Throughout the course we will use the following conventions:\nSymbol Meaning \\(n\\) Number of observations (data points) \\(p\\) Number of predictors (features) \\(\\mathbf{x}_i\\) The \\(p\\)-vector of features for observation \\(i\\) \\(y_i\\) The response (target) for observation \\(i\\) \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) The \\(n\\times p\\) design matrix whose \\(i\\)th row is \\(\\mathbf{x}_i^\\top\\) \\(\\boldsymbol\\beta\\) The \\(p\\)-vector of unknown model coefficients \\(\\varepsilon_i\\) Random error term for observation \\(i\\) \\(\\bar x\\) observed/sample means for random variables \\(x\\) \\(s^2 \\) observed/sample variance for random variables \\(x\\) Before fitting models, let’s recall some foundational ideas:\nRandom Variables \u0026amp; Expectations A random variable \\(Y\\) has a probability distribution. The expected value (mean) is\n\\[\r\\mathbb{E}[Y] = \\mu = \\int y\\,dF_Y(y)\r\\] The variance measures spread:\n\\[\r\\mathrm{Var}(Y) = \\mathbb{E}\\bigl[(Y - \\mu)^2\\bigr] = \\sigma^2.\r\\] Sampling \u0026amp; Estimation The sample mean of \\(y_1,\\dots,y_n\\): \\[\r\\bar y = \\frac1n\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i.\r\\] The sample variance: \\[\rs^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\bar y)^2.\r\\] Covariance \u0026amp; Correlation Covariance of two random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\): \\[\r\\mathrm{Cov}(X,Y) = \\mathbb{E}\\bigl[(X - \\mathbb{E}[X])(Y - \\mathbb{E}[Y])\\bigr].\r\\] Correlation (Pearson’s \\(\\rho\\)) is the standardized covariance: \\[\r\\rho_{XY} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Cov}(X,Y)}{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(X)\\,\\mathrm{Var}(Y)}}.\r\\] We will see how these quantities enter into formulas for parameter estimates, tests, and confidence intervals.\nMotivating Example: House Price Prediction To ground our discussion, we’ll work throughout the course with a real-world dataset of house sales. Our goal:\nPredict the sale price \\(y\\) of a home from features such as:\nSize (\\(\\text{sqft}\\)) Number of bedrooms Age of the home Neighborhood quality (that will be encoded as dummy variables) In notation: \\[\ry_i \\;=\\; \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\,\\text{sqft}_i + \\beta_2\\,\\text{beds}_i + \\beta_3\\,\\text{age}_i + \\cdots + \\varepsilon_i.\r\\]Here is a sample of 10 lines:\nSize Number of bedrooms Age Neighborhood Price 1710 3 5 CollgCr 208500 1262 3 31 Veenker 181500 1786 3 7 CollgCr 223500 1717 3 91 Crawfor 140000 2198 4 8 NoRidge 250000 1362 1 16 Mitchel 143000 1694 3 3 Somerst 307000 2090 3 36 NWAmes 200000 1774 2 77 OldTown 129900 1077 2 69 BrkSide 118000 Here’s your scatter plot of Price (y) vs. Size (x): Later modules will show how to:\nEstimate \\(\\boldsymbol\\beta\\) (Ordinary Least Squares) Test hypotheses about feature effects (t-tests, F-tests) Check model assumptions (residual diagnostics) Extend to generalized linear models (e.g., logistic regression) With our notation and basic statistics clear, we’re ready to dive in to Simple Linear Regression in the next lesson!\n","link":"https://jawad.dev/docs/ml/lm/1_introduction_and_background/","section":"docs","title":"Introduction \u0026 Background"},{"body":"","link":"https://jawad.dev/tags/ai/","section":"tags","title":"AI"},{"body":"","link":"https://jawad.dev/tags/evaluation/","section":"tags","title":"Evaluation"},{"body":"Between May and June 2025, I wrote a series of posts on LinkedIn about the reality of designing, evaluating, and scaling multi-agent AI systems.

It\u0026rsquo;s far more correlated with the number of real cases processed in production.\nWhy?\nBecause evaluation isn\u0026rsquo;t meaningful until your system has faced a wide range of inputs\u0026hellip; and even then, some edge cases won\u0026rsquo;t appear until you\u0026rsquo;re operating at scale.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what we\u0026rsquo;ve observed again and again:\n✅ Complex agent tasks can perform flawlessly in dev, but start breaking down under production load or when inputs deviate even slightly from the original distribution.\n✅ Free text input is unpredictable. No matter how creative your dev team is, users will always surprise you.\n✅ It\u0026rsquo;s not just LLMs : rate limits, data quality issues, and fragile pipelines will all show up once the volume kicks in.\n✅ Even your data pipelines need to be stress tested at scale. You\u0026rsquo;ll spot performance cliffs and resilience gaps only under pressure.\nScaling to production gives your team real signals:\nWhat breaks? Where is the system fragile? What improvements would make the most users happy? With enough volume, your team gets the feedback it needs to iterate faster and with higher confidence.\nScaling isn\u0026rsquo;t a nice-to-have.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s the prerequisite for building reliable and evolving AI systems.\nProduction support and online evaluation are not just ops tasks, they\u0026rsquo;re strategic levers for your team.

𝗙𝗶𝗿𝘀𝘁 𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲 (keeps the chaos out) when it\u0026rsquo;s the input guardrail:\nhelps you catch out of scope/unexpected inputs (things your workflows weren\u0026rsquo;t designed to handle). With these kinds of input, you\u0026rsquo;re almost guaranteed to get unreliable, unpredictable results. It\u0026rsquo;s also your security guard: detecting jailbreaks, prompt injections, and malicious inputs. 𝗟𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲 (keeps the chaos in) when it\u0026rsquo;s the output guardrail:\nIt helps drastically reduce hallucinations. It can flag out-of-scope topics that slipped past the input guardrail. It should also enforce brand moderation, keeping responses aligned with company image and policies. Think of building a 𝗿𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗴𝘂𝗮𝗿𝗱𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗹 as a hard 𝗰𝗹𝗮𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺. Like any classification task, you\u0026rsquo;re tuning the threshold between false positives (blocking good inputs) and false negatives (letting bad ones through).\n𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗻𝗴𝗲?\nYour input and output is human language: open-ended, messy, context-dependent.

Pay the necessary price to have best quality.\n✅ Evaluate performance: Use metrics like accuracy, recall, and precision. Better yet, build custom metrics tied to business impact.\n𝗦𝗼𝗹𝗶𝗱 𝗴𝘂𝗮𝗿𝗱𝗿𝗮𝗶𝗹𝘀 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘃𝗮𝗹𝘂𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗔𝗜 𝘀𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺𝘀 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗼𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗼𝗻𝗲𝘀.\n4.

𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗜𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀: They offer valuable data that can enrich your understanding of the automated process and even serve as a source of structured knowledge about your users. Moreover, these data points should be used to establish hard controls, dictating actions that agents must or must not take based on the extracted information.\nAdditionally, this metadata functions as a form of memory. Ensuring that agents get this information at critical steps of the process and that it\u0026rsquo;s never lost.\n𝗪𝗮𝗻𝘁 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗿𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀?\n𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝗱𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘀𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗰𝗸𝗽𝗼𝗶𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗱.\n5. Building for Scale and Automation R\u0026amp;D is not optional. Be ready to pay for experimentation. If you want to bring cutting-edge AI systems to production, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to build an R\u0026amp;D mindset into your team and invest in experimentation.\nThe challenge?\nKeep experimentation 𝗳𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗮𝗳𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗱𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲.\nYou want feedback in 𝗱𝗮𝘆𝘀, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝘄𝗲𝗲𝗸𝘀.\nAnd just like any expert team, to move fast you need the right tooling.\nAs your production matures and your agent tasks become more complex, your tools need to scale with you.\nAt NORMA, when we started building multi-agent systems, we hit a clear bottleneck: Maintaining constant quality was slowing down our shipping velocity.\nSo, we built something.\n𝗔 𝘁𝗼𝗼𝗹 𝘁𝗼 𝘁𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗔𝗜 𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 𝗲𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝗲𝗻𝗱, 𝗮𝘁 𝘀𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗲.\nIt started as an internal utility.\nToday, it\u0026rsquo;s a full platform for teams who need to control agent quality over time and evaluate changes across versions efficiently.\nYou want reliable and efficient AI?

LLMs are everywhere in your pipeline, each bringing potential variance to your process. Many steps rely on structured outputs from LLMs, which aren\u0026rsquo;t always easy to obtain systematically. Agents may access external sources you don\u0026rsquo;t fully control. Outputs vary widely: generated text, finite decision spaces, data extraction\u0026hellip; AI frameworks themselves are still evolving quickly and might introduce instabilities or deprecate parts of your code overnight. For all these reasons, developers often struggle to build new features while maintaining high production quality and stability.\n𝗗𝗼𝗻\u0026rsquo;𝘁 𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿-𝗽𝗹𝗮𝗻, 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝗮𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗲𝘀𝘁𝘀 𝗻𝗼𝘄 𝘁𝗼 𝗿𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗲𝘃𝗲 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗱𝗲𝘃 𝘁𝗲𝗮𝗺.\nAnything that reduces developer workload is worth pursuing. For example:\nBegin with a simple script that automatically runs tests and saves results to an accessible folder. Execute these tests in parallel to accelerate feedback. Provide a clear dashboard or interface for easily inspecting results. Encourage your team to establish metrics to continuously monitor overall quality. Start by measuring outputs globally, then prioritize evaluating the most critical sub-steps, usually those handling data manipulation.\nAfter several iterations, your developers will become comfortable with evaluation processes, naturally integrating these tests to ensure high-quality features. At NORMA, we’ve even automated evaluation directly into our CI/CD pipeline for every PR 🔥\nCheck our quik demo here: ","link":"https://jawad.dev/blog/multiagents_lessons/","section":"blog","tags":"AI,Production,Evaluation","title":"From PoC to Production"},{"body":"","link":"https://jawad.dev/tags/production/","section":"tags","title":"Production"},{"body":"","link":"https://jawad.dev/tags/","section":"tags","title":"Tags"},{"body":"","link":"https://jawad.dev/tags/entrepreneurship/","section":"tags","title":"Entrepreneurship"},{"body":"On May 22, 2025, I had the opportunity and privilege to speak in front of a group of selected young students participating in a hackathon organized by hackai. My mission was simple yet deeply meaningful to me: to openly share my journey as an entrepreneur who started as a developer, highlighting the lessons learned, the challenges I encountered, and the personal growth opportunities I\u0026rsquo;ve discovered along the way.\nBeing an introvert myself, I particularly wanted to offer insights and practical advice to those who, like me, dream of achieving greater freedom and self-realization through entrepreneurship, despite (or perhaps even because of) their quieter personalities.\nWhen I started my entrepreneurial journey, I quickly observed two main types of businesses. Some are profitable from day one, usually service-based businesses. Others require initial funding to develop their profitability. Given my French-Moroccan cultural background, bootstrapping, which is building a business with minimal investment, was naturally my prefered choice. Our relationship with risk and money tends to be cautious, often shaped by insecurity rather than optimism (yeah\u0026hellip; that\u0026rsquo;s the truth).\nBeyond the financial aspects, entrepreneurship has taught me invaluable lessons about personal growth and ambition. Early on, I understood the importance of fully embracing my strengths and refusing mediocrity. Yet this mindset sometimes caused friction: people might interpret ambition as arrogance or unnecessary perfectionism. I learned not to compromise on my standards just because others saw things differently. Money is indeed essential, but for entrepreneurs, it primarily serves to improve the likelihood of our project\u0026rsquo;s success, not simply as an end goal.\nAn essential realization was that entrepreneurship means solving problems for other people. Genuine curiosity about others\u0026rsquo; lives and difficulties is foundational. If you\u0026rsquo;re seeking tranquility or a predictable life, entrepreneurship probably isn\u0026rsquo;t the right path. For me, entrepreneurship became a continuous practice of stepping outside my comfort zone, understanding that there\u0026rsquo;s always something new and important to master.\nComfort is tricky: you need a baseline level to sustain long-term efforts, but too much comfort can stifle growth. I found it crucial to regularly push my boundaries, constantly absorbing new skills and knowledge.\nOver time, I also realized entrepreneurship isn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily the ultimate ambition for everyone nor should it be. At one point, I considered joining an existing team as a CTO, thinking I might be happier in a secondary role. The right opportunity never emerged, not because good teams didn\u0026rsquo;t exist, but simply due to timing. Eventually, I found people I\u0026rsquo;d gladly join, reminding me how critical timing and context are in our decisions.\nAnother powerful lesson was about humility. I observed brilliant individuals from strong academic backgrounds who often fell prey to a superiority complex. Believing success was owed to them, they underestimated the constant hard work required. Entrepreneurship rapidly dispels any illusions of entitlement.\nOne crucial practice I\u0026rsquo;ve adopted is always giving my best to people who trust and follow me. Nothing is more powerful than a unified team, and that unity is built on genuine effort and mutual respect. However, this requires trust—sometimes blind trust in others. While some experiences might disappoint you, investing your time and trust in people consistently opens new opportunities.\nI had to become ok with discomfort in other ways too—like paying upfront to learn or taking risks by selling ideas before fully executing them. Initially, this went against my natural instinct for caution, but it proved crucial in creating new opportunities and connections.\n\u0026lsquo;Two metrics emerged as especially meaningful for me: the number of new people I meet each day and my ability to maintain quality conversations with them.\u0026rsquo; I\u0026rsquo;ve worked consciously to improve these metrics, finding that they directly impacted my entrepreneurial success.\nInstead of dwelling on what I lacked or what seemed impossible, I learned to focus strictly on the value I could deliver and the actions within my control. Playing the victim never advanced anyone\u0026rsquo;s goals. Though we don\u0026rsquo;t all begin our journey from the same point, it\u0026rsquo;s more productive and satisfying to concentrate on possibilities rather than obstacles.\nFailures inevitably happened. \u0026lsquo;I also learned not to expect constant support from close friends or family.\u0026rsquo; Initially, their perceived lack of support frustrated me, but I eventually understood that their apparent reluctance was not personal; often, they were already burdened by their own concerns and fears.\nAccepting my weaknesses was another critical breakthrough. Being average in certain areas won\u0026rsquo;t necessarily limit success. Ego and imposter syndrome plagued me frequently, but gradually diminished as I learned to see them simply as temporary feelings rather than truths.\nTo grow effectively, I discovered that hiring or collaborating with people smarter or more capable than myself was indispensable. I used to hesitate, worried that this could highlight my shortcomings. Now, I seek out these relationships deliberately, knowing they\u0026rsquo;re the quickest path to improvement.\nMy perspective expanded further when I began exploring economics and game theory, understanding that entrepreneurship is about far more than hard skills. Working on my resilience also allowed my creativity to flourish. \u0026lsquo;Building resilience will buy you enough time to spark innovation.\u0026rsquo;\nAlongside resilience, learning to work comfortably in teams and exposing myself regularly to criticism proved immensely beneficial. It strengthened my confidence and clarified my ideas. This also required a conscious effort never to judge prematurely. I\u0026rsquo;ve realized repeatedly that good and bad qualities coexist in everyone. There\u0026rsquo;s potential common ground with any person if you look openly enough and if it aligns with your business goals.\nProfessionalism, perhaps more than any other single quality, became fundamental in my entrepreneurial life. Clearly communicating intentions, and consistently doing what you promise, is powerful and irreplaceable. Yes, some people inevitably take advantage of your goodwill, but I\u0026rsquo;ve learned that this isn\u0026rsquo;t always negative, provided it helps move your project forward positively.\nAbove all, entrepreneurship demands courage. Not just the courage to lead but also to openly depend on others. Initially, I was hesitant to ask for help, mistakenly seeing self-reliance as strength. Entrepreneurship quickly corrected this misconception, as trying to handle everything alone became exhausting and counterproductive. Learning to ask for help turned out to be one of my most important lessons.\nLastly, I learned not to take myself too seriously. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t control every outcome or constantly sacrifice my own well-being for others. Sacrifices inevitably happen, yet choosing entrepreneurship in a field I genuinely love—m (math and technology) made these sacrifices easier to accept.\nEveryone defines success differently. For entrepreneurs, the relationship between time invested and immediate financial reward can feel frustratingly disconnected. I had to gradually separate the value of my time from immediate compensation. Results often arrive later, sometimes much later, as the business grows. This delayed gratification felt destabilizing at first, especially when accustomed to direct compensation.\nUltimately, my choices affect other people\u0026rsquo;s lives. I\u0026rsquo;ve had to accept responsibility for the relationships, opportunities, and even problems my decisions create.\n","link":"https://jawad.dev/blog/5-years-of-norma/","section":"blog","tags":"Entrepreneurship,PersonalGrowth","title":"Lessons learned (so far) as an introvert entrepreneur"},{"body":"","link":"https://jawad.dev/tags/personalgrowth/","section":"tags","title":"PersonalGrowth"},{"body":"","link":"https://jawad.dev/blog/","section":"blog","title":"Blog"},{"body":"","link":"https://jawad.dev/categories/","section":"categories","title":"Categories"},{"body":"\rHi!
